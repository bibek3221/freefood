            <p>College students in Silicon Valley are seeking a better life for themselves and their families through higher education, but don't have the money to meet their basic needs in the process. Many discover that trying to be a full-time student while having a full-time job to pay for necessities is almost impossible and contributes to college hunger and food insecurity. Graduating college can make a substantial difference to a household's overall income. According to the 2024 Silicon Valley Index, Silicon Valley workers with a bachelor's degree earned an estimated $57,000 more than those with only a high school diploma in 2022.</p>
            <p>This means food insecurity in college students jeopardizes not only their degrees but also their future earning potential.</p>
